  <h2 itemprop="name"> What to do when I have symptoms? </h2>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
The main symptoms of the coronavirus disease include increased temperature, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and headache.
However, not everyone who has those symptoms is infected with the coronavirus.  How to proceed if I do have symptoms corresponding to that disease?</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody"> If you have difficulty breathing or have a fever and a dry cough, call 155 immediately and follow the operator‚Äôs instructions.  If you have a fever that lasts for more than two days or a dry cough without a fever, call your general practitioner or an emergency room (outside of your GP‚Äôs hours) and proceed in line with their instructions.
If you are over 60 years old and have any of the above symptoms, contact your general practitioner or an emergency room (outside of your GP‚Äôs hours) and proceed in line with their instructions.  If you have only a fever and for less than two days, take care of yourself and others: stay in home quarantine, observe yourself, and take medication to lower your fever.
If you do not have any of the above symptoms, it is probably not COVID-19 at this point.  Keep calm, monitor your health status, and take your temperature twice a day.  If you have any other urgent medical difficulties, consult your doctor.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody"> Testing. If you receive a recommendation or a request form for a test from your doctor, you must find an appropriate sampling point.
If you do not have a request form for a test from your doctor but you do have symptoms of the disease, proceed in line with the process described above.
If you have neither a request form for a test from your doctor nor any symptoms of the disease, you are not indicated for a test for the presence of the novel coronavirus.
You can still have it done, but only at certain sampling points and you have to pay for its yourself (the price is approximately CZK 2,900).
We urge persons who have symptoms of the disease who are in home quarantine (note: not the same as the ‚Äúnational quarantine‚Äù), do not travel to the sampling point by public or shared transport, in order to prevent infecting others.
Travel to the sampling point by your own car, going by yourself or with a maximum of one person, and cover your respiratory passages.</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody"> Test results. You will receive information about your test results from your doctor or from the Regional Public Hygiene Station (RPHS).
 Please wait for them to contact you.  With laboratories and sampling points being busy, it can take several days for you to get your results.
If you are also in home-quarantine, continue to adhere to its rules.
If you test positive, remain at home in isolation, contact your GP by phone, and follow his instructions.
If you test negative, you do not need to stay in home-quarantine, but do not forget about adhering to essential recommendations as to hygiene.</p>
